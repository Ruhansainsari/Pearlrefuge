            <h2>Kosgoda- The serene beach town of Sri Lanka's southern coast</h2>
            <p>You can choose between taking the more scenic route along Galle Road or the speedier Southern Highway when heading to Kosgoda from Colombo. With Bentota, Hikkaduwa, and Galle nearby, Kosgoda is the perfect location to take advantage of everything these bustling tourist destinations have to offer while also unwinding on the tranquil beaches at the end of a long day. For those who enjoy watching birds, the Kosgoda lagoon provides a perfect setting. Boat excursions are another option, and a trip to the turtle hatcheries to view the turtle conservation initiatives is a requirement.</p>

        <h2>Turtle Hatcheries of Kosgoda</h2>
        <p>Kosgoda has gained notoriety for its turtle conservation initiatives, which throughout the year draw a large number of local and international tourists. Millions of juvenile turtles have been released safely back into the wild as a result of these conservation programmes, which assist to save turtles from extinction in Sri Lanka. Although their primary laying period is from October to April, green turtles at Kosgoda lay eggs virtually all year round.</p>

                    <h2>Hatcheries</h2>
                    <p>Collected from beach nests or even purchased from poachers to prevent market sale, are reburied in the hatchery where they can safely hatch. Hatchlings should never be released during the daytime, thus the majority are released as soon as possible at night. However, some are held back for a brief time to give them a "headstart" until they are stronger.</p>

Volunteers will have the opportunity to participate in giving tours of the project and imparting some of their newly acquired information to residents and visitors. The conservation of these intriguing animals depends on public understanding of them, their threats, and how to protect them.</p>
