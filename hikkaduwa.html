            <h3>Release of Baby Turtles</h3>
            <p>Releasing of baby turtles can be observed if you visit a hatchery at 5.00am in the morning. This is a wonderful experience. To prevent birds from getting to the eggs, a netting has been used to secure them. The young turtles are kept in a tank after hatching until they are ready to be released into the ocean. For an extra cost, you can pay to have turtles returned to the water.</p>
