        <h1>Sea Turtle Categories </h1>
        <p>Turtles are cold-blooded animals since they are reptiles (Class: Reptilia, Order: Chelonia). Consequently, their body temperature is influenced by their surroundings. To raise their body temperature in the morning, marine turtles ''sunbathe'' at the water's surface. To raise their body temperature in the morning, marine turtles ''sunbathe'' at the water's surface. They have lungs so they can breathe. Every 30 minutes, turtles come to the surface to breathe. They have evolved to be extremely well adapted to living in a marine environment over millions of years. Marine turtles are nimble swimmers thanks to their flattened, streamlined shells, long, strong fore flippers that resemble oars, and their hind flippers that resemble rudders. Five of the seven species of sea turtles are found on the island, including the Green, Olive Ridley, Hawksbill, Loggerhead, and Leatherback turtles.

        <h2>Green Turtles</h2>
        <img src="webphotos/greenturtle.png">
        <p>In Sri Lanka, the green turtle is the one that is most frequently encountered. The Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans all contain them. The colour of the fat behind their shells, which is tragically used to produce turtle soup, is referenced in their English name. Thankfully, this practise is less widespread now. Carnivores predominate among young green turtles. Adults, however, are herbivores that use their sharply serrated jaws to only consume marine flora. They can weigh up to 250 kg and reach a maximum length of 1m. A mature female will typically lay 120–140 eggs at a cycle. Near the Kosgoda Beach and Rekawa Beach (near Tangalle), green turtles are frequently spotted on the beach at night.

          <h2>Hawksbill Turtles</h2>
          <img src="webphotos/hawksbill.jpg">
          <p>
            More rare than the Green Turtle is the severely endangered Hawksbill Turtle. It weighs between 50 and 70 kg and has a maximum length of 90 cm. It is also much smaller.The hawksbill's tiny head and bird-like beak, which are employed to hunt creatures hidden in small cracks, are what give it its English name. It frequently travels to tropical and subtropical waters, including Sri Lanka. Despite being one of the lesser sea turtle species, this one is recognised for having a stunning shell that is composed of 13 symmetrical sections and is quite colourful. Pigeon Island national park located in Trincomalee has a high density of Hawksbill Turtles which can be clearly observed.    </p>

          <h2>Loggerhead Turtles</h2>
          <img src="webphotos/loggerhead.jpg">
            <p>The Loggerhead Turtle is uncommon in Sri Lanka and more frequent in the East Coast of the United States. As their name implies, they are often red and brown in hue, and their enormous head makes them highly recognisable. It weights between 170 and 200kg and reaches a height of 1m. They are mostly carnivores, and their powerful jaws are perfect for crushing crabs and mollusks. A huge marine turtle that can weigh up to 280 kilogrammes is the loggerhead. They got their name from the shape of their enormous, log-like skull. The degradation of its nesting places and other human activities like bycatch have made the loggerhead turtle a critically endangered species in Sri Lanka. Commonly spotted in beaches like Kosgoda, Rekawa and Bundala.

            <h2>Olive Ridley Turtles</h2>
            <img src="webphotos/oliveturtle.jpg">
            <p>This turtle's population is in danger because it is dependent on the safety of a select few beaches in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. For their flesh and hide, they have historically been targeted intensively for hunting. The Olive Ridley turtle, the smaller of the two species of ridley turtles, grows to a maximum size of 65 cm and weighs 35–45 kg. It gets its name from the colour of its rusty-olive shell. Every year, Olive Ridley Turtles lay their eggs, many of which can number over 150, on Kosgoda Beach. They consume fish, crabs, and some marine vegetation because they are omnivores. Essentially these turtles can be mostly observed in the Yala beaches as well as in Kosgoda and Trincomalee. </p>

              <h2>Leatherback Turtles</h2>
              <img src="webphotos/leatherback.jpg">
              <p>They can reach heights much beyond 160 cm and weigh over 700 kg. This species' shell resembles leather in texture and is softer and more flexible than the green turtle's. These marine critters can survive in colder temperatures and dive to depths of up to 1000 m because of their thick covering of insulating fat. These enormous creatures are particularly vulnerable to floating plastic waste in our oceans because jellyfish are their preferred meal. This turtle species is considered vulnerable by experts. Rarely, leatherback turtles have been spotted off the coast of Sri Lanka around Kosgoda, Mawolla, Rekawa beach or in the Nothern waters of the island.</p>
