          <h1>Sri Lankan Turtle Population</h1>
          <p class="paraone"> 
            In Sri Lankan beaches, five of the seven sea turtle species found in the world green turtles, leatherbacks, olive ridleys, hawksbills, and loggerheads—come to lay their eggs. Sea turtles have significant nesting and foraging grounds around the south and southeast coasts, which have large expanses of sea grass beds and coral reefs. In this region, there are many people living close together, and the tourist industry is heavily focused along the coasts. Although fishing is the main source of income in the majority of coastal Sri Lankan communities, people also rely heavily on other natural resources, such as sea turtles. The over-harvesting of turtles for their meat, eggs, and other items is frequently linked to poverty in coastal communities. There are financial advantages connected with the market sale of turtle flesh, eggs, and scutes in addition to the food that they supply for a person's household.
          <br> <br> Sea turtle population declines are a key worry for conservation biologists, and all sea turtle species are now protected on a global scale. It is illegal to catch, kill, harm, or possess sea turtles or their eggs in Sri Lanka, according to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (FFPO, 1938 revised in 1972). Sea turtle items cannot be traded internationally, according to Sri Lanka. Sea turtles and their eggs are still used for commercial purposes in some regions of the country, despite the fact that this has led to a significant decrease in slaughtering.

            <p> Pear Refuge is an autonomous non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Sri Lanka that was founded in 1993 and registered with the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) in March 1995. Pearl Refuge is currently run by a committee of seven Sri Lankan citizens in accordance with a constitution that has been accepted. We work with government agencies, academic institutions, and other non-governmental organisations to develop and facilitate the implementation of sustainable marine turtle conservation plans.</p>

            <h1>Sea Turtle Hatcheries</h1>
            <p>There are five kinds of threatened sea turtles that call Sri Lanka home, and they are in risk due to poaching, habitat degradation, and pollution. Turtle hatcheries have been built throughout the nation's coastline to save turtle eggs and release young turtles into the ocean as a response to these dangers.
            </p>
            
            <p>In Sri Lanka, sea turtle conservation and protection are greatly aided by turtle hatcheries. These hatcheries offer a secure environment for turtle eggs to hatch, releasing young turtles into the sea safe from both predatory animals and human activity. Sea turtles play a significant role in maintaining the harmony of the marine food chain and the marine ecology. Additionally, by generating jobs and revenue for local communities through ecotourism, turtle hatcheries contribute to the local economy. Following are some hatcheries not to be missed.

              <li>
                <p>As a considerate visitor, be sure to avoid turning on the torch on the camera or smartphone because female sea turtles like to lay their eggs in quiet, dark places.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Try not to feed any of this wildlife because doing so could leave them vulnerable to unforeseen illnesses and infections.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Keep a safe distance away from these sea turtles' nesting areas.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Avoid leaving any carbon footprints behind during your visit to the Sea Turtle Hatchery; otherwise, climatic changes may alter their food sources and cause the negative effects of its bioaccumulation.</p>

              <p>Sea turtle conservation activities are essential to safeguarding them in Sri Lanka. Turtle hatcheries have been built by numerous organisations and governmental bodies to safeguard the eggs from predators and human activity. In order to increase their chances of survival, these hatcheries release the newly hatched turtles into the ocean. We can admire sea turtles' beauty and support their conservation efforts by going to turtle hatcheries and seeing them in their natural settings. We must cooperate to safeguard sea turtles so that present and future generations may enjoy them. Sri Lanka is incredibly fortunate to be home to five of the world's seven sea turtle species.
